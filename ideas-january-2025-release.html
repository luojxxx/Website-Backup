<h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">THE MOTIVATION</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The ideas section is a place to offload and share various ideas I’ve come up. Although these are only the ideas that have already been implemented, tested, something I’m not interested in doing, or technically incomplete (meaning there’s various technical progress that needs to be accomplished before it’s applicable), however, it has definitely been conceived by me independently. Then there’s the secret ideas that I can’t quite reveal yet because I want to develop it first or because it maybe patentable and I want to protect my ability to patent it and open source it globally. Overall, these ideas serve to share the kind of practical imagination I have but also to share the journey into the future:</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
<h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Theories OF aging</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I believe aging is evolutionarily favored, but in a particular way. First aging is the trade off between genomic-stability/long-life vs evolution. The more stable your genome, the fewer mutations, the less epigenetic aging, and the longer you live, but the less you’ll evolve. Or another way to put it, if you had an organism that had very high mutation rates, it wouldn’t live very long but would evolve quickly; whereas if you had a organism that had very low mutation rates, it would live much longer but wouldn’t evolve very fast. That’s why when animals find a very stable protective niche, they live longer because then they don’t need to evolve; while living longer still evolved even with more genomic stability since it provides a very strong selective benefit to be able to have more children over their lifespan. And the research backs this idea, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)01377-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867422013770%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#:~:text=Comparative%20analysis%20of%20the%20mutational%20landscape%20across%20mammalian%20species%20has%20shown%20that%20species%2Dspecific%20somatic%20mutation%20rate%20is%20inversely%20correlated%20with%20lifespan." target="_blank">it was found that the somatic mutation rate of a species is inversely correlated with lifespan</a> meaning the more basal-level mutations there were the shorter the lifespan and vice versa. Second, aging speeds up the evolutionary cycles kind of like planned obsolescence, which was already published <a href="/ideas-june-2024-release/#aging-theories-and-experiments">here</a>, but here’s the gist of it. There’s an evolutionary advantage to aging, by making individuals age, it makes room for their offspring who could be better adapted to their environment. It fits alongside the disposable soma theory where as long as the organism can reproduce what happens to the main body afterwards doesn’t matter; but not only does it not matter, it’s good for evolution. And again animals in a safe protective niche live longer because they don’t have the evolutionary pressure requiring faster evolutionary cycles and therefore live longer. Plus it explains how a <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2007/10/102450/genes-both-extend-life-and-protect-against-cancer-identified#:~:text=The%20worms%2C%20known%20formally%20as%20Caenorhabditis%20elegans%2C%20were%20the%20stars%20of%20a%20startling%201993%20discovery%20by%20UCSF%20biologist%20Cynthia%20Kenyon%2C%20PhD.%20She%20found%20then%20that%20a%20change%20in%20just%20one%20gene%2C%20called%20daf%2D2%2C%20doubled%20the%20worms%27%20lifespan." target="_blank">single mutated gene in C. elegans allowed it to double it’s lifespan</a>; why wasn’t this already evolved by evolution, because population wise it was evolutionarily disadvantageous. A key experiment I want to run to verify this is to run an ecological study where long lived yeast are competing against short lived yeast on the same petri dish in the face of evolutionary pressure like changes in resources, pH, temperature, etc, and see which population wins out.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Finally I believe aging is in part a epigenetically heritable stress response to damage for planned demolition. This is because OSK factors would not be able to revert old cells back to the youthful cells (to the point where you can create a healthy mouse from the youthful IPSCs) if the aging damage was random. It is in response to multiple sources of damage like DNA damage (seen from experiments with ICE mice, which have repairable DNA breaks induced in their genome or the paper that described how somatic mutation rates are inversely related to lifespan), but also other <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10077971/#:~:text=We%20show%20that%20although%20epigenetic%20aging%20is%20distinct%20from%20cellular%20senescence%2C%20telomere%20attrition%20and%20genomic%20instability%2C%20it%20is%20associated%20with%20nutrient%20sensing%2C%20mitochondrial%20activity%20and%20stem%20cell%20composition" target="_blank">damage like mitochondrial activity or nutrient sensing</a>. The Hovath clock is a measure of this epigenetically heritable stress response, since it measures the common epigenetic changes across cells over increasing age. And there needs to be a way of reversing this stress response in preparation for the next generation of the organism, which is why OSK, pluripotent master transcription regulators induced in the early stages of the embryo, reverses it. The purpose of this aging stress response is to either prevent cellular decoherence or cancer. Cellular decoherence is when cells in the same organism evolve away from each other thus making them unable to function as a whole (in terms of DNA damage but also other forms of damage like mitochondrial damage). And cancer is just a variant of cellular decoherence where a cell evolved to the point of uncontrolled growth. And there’s evidence of this, <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115#:~:text=Analysis%20of%206%2C000%20cancer%20samples%20from%2032%20datasets%20showed%20that%20all%20of%20the%20considered%2020%20cancer%20types%20exhibit%20significant%20age%20acceleration%2C%20with%20an%20average%20of%2036%20years." target="_blank">a paper used the Horvath epigenetic clock to check the age of cancer cells, and found across all considered cancer types significant age acceleration with an average of 36 years</a>. A further experiment could take regular cells and cells aged via ICE method, then knock out specific tumor suppressors to turn them into cancerous cells, then inject them into mice of various ages to observe survival rates with the expectation that the younger the mouse and the older the cancer the better the survival rates. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think there’s likely not a single reason why organisms age, but it’s all these different forces put together sum up to what we see as aging.</p>

<h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sirutins</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Double strand breaks have epigenetics that lead to an unpacked DNA (via histone acetylation) to fix the DNA break. Once it’s fixed, the acetylation is supposed to be removed. So when this deacetylation process is not 100%, there’ll be leftover acetyl groups on the histones contributing to an unpacked phenotype. This could be what leads to a more globally unpacked phenotype with age and why overexpressing sirtuins (a histone deacetylase) improves lifespan. This can be assessed experimentally by comparing aged cells vs youthful cells. And overall, in the normal functioning of the genome opening and closing DNA could result in leftover marks that contribute together to increased age.</p>
